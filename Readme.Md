## Coulomb

Coulomb is a boilerplate for telling stories about programming. Coulomb leans on the Docker runtime to provide a local Linux environment in a cross platform way. It also depends on Electron for driving cross platform user interfaces in the native environment (outside the browser).

Beyond this base, the boilerplate includes some common widgets and storytelling components to make it easier to get started. The best way to get started is by forking this repo and reading through some example stories for inspiring your own story telling. The boilerplate assumes your story is written inside the index.js file. Simply type `npm start` to run.
